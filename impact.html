		<h1>Importance of the Space Race</h1>
		<br>
		<p>All in all, the Space Race was a time of many developments. Most prominently, there were technological developments in the form of advanced aerospace technology unlike anything seen before in history. There were political developments where the competition of the Space Race echoed the throes and tensions of the Cold War going on between its belligerents. There were even social developments; simple men could become space-traveling astronauts, and women could gain access to jobs they never before had the opportunity of having. The effects of these technological, political, and social developments can still be seen today. Many races have a definite winner. While the US was recognized as the winner of the Space Race, it seems that everyone managed to win something from the Space Race.</p>
