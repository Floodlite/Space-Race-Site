		<h1>Context of the Space Race</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, the United Soviet Socialist Republic and the United States were engaged in a Cold War. The former wanted to expand their ideology, Communism, across the globe, and the latter sought to contain it from spreading. This war was not fought through battles or skirmishes, but with politics and proxy conflicts. During this war, there was a race going on, but not the one you are probably expecting from the topic of this website, the Arms Race. Both the US and USSR were rapidly stockpiling nuclear weapons in order to discourage the other side from using their nuclear weapons against them. This mad scramble for new, advantageous tech and rapacious rocketry gave way to the race you probably came here for, the Space Race. 
The Space Race began proper in 1957 when the Soviets launched a satellite, Sputnik, into orbit around the globe. From that point onwards, both sides competed to one-up the other in terms of new aeronautics accomplishments (this section will not be a recap of the Space Race, refer to the succeeding section for more information).
Curiously, the Space Race did not initially have a concrete goal until American president, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, announced during a speech that it would be to travel to the Moon and back without any casualties.</p>
<p>There was a lot at stake for both countries in the Space Race. The winner would gain the prestige of being the first to do something that nobody has ever done before in history, and establish that they had superior technology; spoils all too valuable in the competitive nature of the <b>Cold War</b>.</p>
